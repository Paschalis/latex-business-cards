### Getting Started

1. **Customize the Front Design**:
   - Replace the placeholder logo in the `.tex` file with your logo.
   - Edit the circular text to include your desired text (e.g., "Your Company Name").
   
2. **Customize the Back Design**:
   - Generate a QR code with your information (e.g., a URL or contact details).
   - Replace the placeholder QR code in the `.tex` file with the generated QR code.

3. **Compile the Design**:
   - Use your LaTeX editor or Overleaf to compile the `.tex` file for printing.

4. **Print Instructions**:
